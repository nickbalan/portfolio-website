            <p><br>Hi everyone,</p>
            <p>
              <br>
              I'm Nick Balan. I was born and raised in the capital city of Rep. Moldova - Chișinău. Also, in the same
              city, I
              completed my
              master's degree and then, right after graduation, moved to Romania for two years. After that, I moved to
              Germany, where
              I have lived for over six years.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              My parents were born in the USSR, but my grandparents were born in Greater Romania. "How is this
              possible?" you might
              ask.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              According to history, in 1940, the Soviet Union (USSR) issued an ultimatum to Greater Romania (currently
              Romania)
              requesting the cession of Bessarabia (the current Republic of Moldova) and Northern Bukovina. Thus, the
              region of
              Bessarabia (the present Republic of Moldova) and Northern Bukovina was annexed to the USSR, remaining part
              of it for
              half a century until 1991, when the Republic of Moldova declared its independence from the USSR.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              That being said, when I was born in Chisinau, this city was part of the USSR at the time, and therefore, I
              was initially
              a citizen of the USSR, but this country dissolved a few years after I was born. Thus, in 1991, the
              Chisinau parliament
              declared its independence, the Romanian language was declared the official state language, and thus
              Moldova became
              independent.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Then, after completing my master's degree in Chisinau, I
              regained my Romanian citizenship, the legal premise resulting
              from my grandparents being Romanian citizens. So I am a citizen
              of both Moldova and Romania at the same time, which is confirmed
              by both my identity documents and my genealogical roots.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              So, as a baby and as a result of historical events, I automatically became one of the first citizens of
              Moldova. It
              should also be mentioned here that, in Moldova, I went to kindergarten, high school, and university, all
              taught in
              Romanian.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Then, after completing my master's degree in Chisinau, I regained my Romanian citizenship, the legal
              premise resulting
              from my grandparents being Romanian citizens. So, I am a citizen of both Moldova and Romania at the same
              time, which is
              confirmed by both my identity documents and my genealogical roots.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              I hope this brief historical summary explains my mixed origins in some way or another.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>

              Moldova is the country where I was born, where I grew up, where I finished my master's degree. It's where
              most of my
              relatives, childhood friends, and former master's classmates are.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Moldova is the place of my childhood and student life, the place that I love and hate simultaneously, in a
              ratio of
              50/50. Moldova is where I had many happy moments but more unhappy moments. I can say that I know so much
              about what it's
              like to live in a country that hasn't woken up from the dream of the Soviet empire and that it potentially
              would take me
              more than a lifetime to write novels on this topic. That's why I will happily skip this dramatic part of
              the story and
              tell you just the positive side of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              You won't believe that the most beautiful moments of my life in Moldova were things that would seem
              trivial to some of
              you. However, they were the only happy moments and are foundation stones for me: 1. All the happy moments
              with my
              family, relatives, and close friends. 2. When I had the opportunity to study at the university with
              extraordinary
              lecturers, PhDs in the field, and amazing colleagues; 3. When I had the chance to participate in the
              TEMPUS student
              exchange program at the Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart (2012); 4. When I happily completed my master's
              degree in
              Geoinformatics (2013), 5. When I finally regained Romanian citizenship (2014);
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              These were the most remarkable moments of my life in Moldova. I will always be grateful to the
              extraordinary people from
              Chișinău with whom I interacted throughout this period. Many more beautiful moments in my life followed
              just after I
              left Moldova, but I will tell you about them on another occasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Thus, after 2014, I decided to leave my parental home and find a purpose in the world, so I moved to
              Romania for two
              years and then to Germany, where I have lived since then until now. I do not intend to return to Moldova
              because every
              travel to Chisinau, even for three days, makes me feel unhappy by remembering all the drama I lived there.
              Also, my
              professional and personal goals are no longer directly related to my country of origin — more details
              about this topic

              <hr>
            </div>
            <p>
              <br>
              Romania is the country that I consider the mother country of my homeland - Rep. Moldova. My grandparents
              were
              born in
              Romania, so I am also Romanian, genetically speaking. Also, the region of Bassarabia, today known as Rep.
              Moldova, was
              forcibly separated and annexed to the USSR by a war ultimatum.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Thus, from my subjective point of view, Moldova and Romania should be diplomatically united within the
              European Union
              (UE). Significantly, the Romanian language is the state language of both countries, and both countries
              have many common
              Romanian traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Although Romania is not a role model EU country for other European countries, it could be the best role
              model for
              Moldova's EU integration. If Moldova would reach at least the level of Romania's EU integration, it would
              be
              extraordinary, but there is still a long way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Unfortunately, Moldova kept getting lost on its UE path, taking one step forward and one step back. Thus,
              for three
              decades of independence from the USSR, Moldova remained in the same place, pacing and moving in circles
              around its
              stagnation. Only now, citizens in Moldova still need to decide whether they want to join the EU or non
              existing USSR.
              Some of them still seem to like the USSR of the past, even though the USSR doesn't exist anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Also, from my purely subjective point of view, Romania and Moldova would do well to take inspiration from
              Germany and
              look for a diplomatic solution for reunification within the EU. Especially now, with the war in Ukraine,
              this would be
              the best possible solution for both countries' economic and social development. Plus, from a historical
              point of view,
              they have always represented only one country, a country unified by the Romanian language and tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              You may ask now why I don't consider Romania my country of destination; it's simple - I am waiting
              patiently for the
              reunification of Romania and Moldova within the EU, and after that, if necessary, I will rethink my
              country of destination.
              However, such an
              event would take years or even decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              By the way, Germany also did a reunification 30 years ago, which only strengthened it. Imagine, by
              aberration, how the
              EU would have been now if Germany had not reunified in 1990. Would those two German countries have been
              separated as
              strongly as the current reunified Germany is? I'm sure not; social division only leads to decline and
              degradation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              With all my heart, I wish to see the reunification of Romania with Moldova within the EU. Suppose current
              generations
              will not get a chance to witness a reunification. In that case, I hope that future generations will be
              able to
              accomplish what our current generations may not be able to accomplish.

            <p>
              <br>
              Germany is the country that inspired me and continues to inspire me ever since I visited it for the first
              time in 2012
              as part of a student exchange at Stuttgart Technology University of Applied Sciences (HFT
              Stuttgart). This
              exchange of students lasted only three months, the most beautiful months of my life up to that point.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Also, in 2012, I was impressed by the German educational, social, and economic systems and how the German
              state creates
              conditions for society to develop and prosper nationally and within the European Union (EU). The German
              academic,
              economic, social, and legal systems are well established and enable German society to explore its
              potential to the
              maximum possible extent.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              However, I want to be understood correctly: the German system is not perfect but very close to perfection.
              This world
              has no ideal system, and any system has advantages and disadvantages. Thus, I will highlight the
              advantages and
              disadvantages of the German, Romanian, and Moldovan systems in future articles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              At the same time, after six years of living in Germany, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to be part
              of German and
              EU society. Although I realize I will never be considered a German, it doesn't bother me at all; I know
              who I am and
              where I come from, and I have no reason to hide my unfair background. The past is past and can not be
              changed, so I'm
              working on improving my present and future. It is much more important for me to have the opportunity to be
              part of and
              contribute to a German and EU society. On the other hand, Germany is also considered one of the role model
              countries for any EU nation.
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              At the moment, Germany is the place where I want to develop myself professionally and personally and
              contribute as much as
              possible to both German and European society. Although my relatives and friends from Moldova and Romania
              find it strange
              that I don't want to relocate to my country of origin, I don't consider it abnormal.
