              <p><br />Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>
                <br />
                I'm Nick Balan; I was born and raised in Chisinau, Moldova; in
                the same city, I completed a master's degree, then moved to
                Romania for two years; after that, I moved to Germany, where I
                have been living for more than six years.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                My parents were born in the USSR, but my grandparents were born
                in Greater Romania. "How is this possible?" you might ask.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                According to history, in 1940, the Soviet Union (USSR) issued an
                ultimatum to Greater Romania (currently Romania) requesting the
                cession of Bessarabia (the current Republic of Moldova) and
                Northern Bukovina. Thus, the region of Bessarabia (the current
                Republic of Moldova) and Northern Bukovina was annexed to the
                USSR, remaining part of it for half a century until 1991, when
                the Republic of Moldova declared its independence from the USSR.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                That being said, when I was born in Chisinau, this city was part
                of the USSR at the time, and therefore I was initially a citizen
                of the USSR, but this country dissolved a few years after I was
                born. Thus, in 1991, the Chisinau parliament declared its
                independence, the Romanian language was declared the official
                state language, and thus Moldova became independent. So as a
                baby and as a result of historical events, I automatically
                became one of the first citizens of Moldova. It should also be
                mentioned here that, in Moldova, I went to kindergarten, high
                school, and university, all taught in Romanian.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                Then, after completing my master's degree in Chisinau, I
                regained my Romanian citizenship, the legal premise resulting
                from my grandparents being Romanian citizens. So I am a citizen
                of both Moldova and Romania at the same time, which is confirmed
                by both my identity documents and my genealogical roots.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                I hope this brief historical summary explains my mixed origins
                in some way or another.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />

                relationship with Romania and the European Union, I would

                <br />
                Moldova is the country where I was born, where I grew up, where
                I finished my master's degree. It's where most of my relatives,
                childhood friends, and former master's classmates are.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                Moldova is the place of my childhood and student life, the place
                that I love and hate simultaneously, in a ratio of 50/50.
                Moldova is where I had many happy moments and unhappy moments. I
                can say that I know so much about what it's like to live in a
                country that hasn't woken up from the dream of the Soviet empire
                and that it potentially would take me a lifetime to write novels
                on this topic. That's why I will happily skip this dramatic part
                of the story and tell you the positive side of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                You won't believe that the most beautiful moments of my life in
                Moldova were simple things that would seem trivial to some of
                you. However, they were and are foundation stones for me: 1.
                When I had the opportunity to study at the university with
                extraordinary lecturers, PhDs in the field, and amazing
                colleagues; 2. When I had the chance to participate in the
                TEMPUS student exchange program at the Hochschule für Technik
                Stuttgart (2012); 3. When I completed a master's degree in
                Geoinformatics (2013), 4. When I regained Romanian citizenship
                (2014).
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                These were the most remarkable moments of my life in Moldova. I
                will always be grateful to the extraordinary people from
                Chișinău with whom I interacted throughout this period. Many
                other beautiful moments in my life also followed after I left
                Moldova, but I will tell you about them on another occasion.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                Thus, after 2014, I decided to leave my parental home and find a
                purpose in the world, so I moved to Romania for two years and
                then to Germany, where I have lived since then until now. I do
                not intend to return to Moldova because my professional and
                personal goals are no longer directly related to my country of
                origin — more details about this topic in subsequent posts.
