            <p><br>Hi everyone,</p>
            <p>
              <br>
              I'm Nick Balan; I was born and raised in Chisinau, Moldova; in
              the same city, I completed a master's degree, then moved to
              Romania for two years; after that, I moved to Germany, where I
              have been living for more than six years.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              My parents were born in the USSR, but my grandparents were born
              in Greater Romania. "How is this possible?" you might ask.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              According to history, in 1940, the Soviet Union (USSR) issued an
              ultimatum to Greater Romania (currently Romania) requesting the
              cession of Bessarabia (the current Republic of Moldova) and
              Northern Bukovina. Thus, the region of Bessarabia (the current
              Republic of Moldova) and Northern Bukovina was annexed to the
              USSR, remaining part of it for half a century until 1991, when
              the Republic of Moldova declared its independence from the USSR.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              That being said, when I was born in Chisinau, this city was part
              of the USSR at the time, and therefore I was initially a citizen
              of the USSR, but this country dissolved a few years after I was
              born. Thus, in 1991, the Chisinau parliament declared its
              independence, the Romanian language was declared the official
              state language, and thus Moldova became independent. So as a
              baby and as a result of historical events, I automatically
              became one of the first citizens of Moldova. It should also be
              mentioned here that, in Moldova, I went to kindergarten, high
              school, and university, all taught in Romanian.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Then, after completing my master's degree in Chisinau, I
              regained my Romanian citizenship, the legal premise resulting
              from my grandparents being Romanian citizens. So I am a citizen
              of both Moldova and Romania at the same time, which is confirmed
              by both my identity documents and my genealogical roots.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              I hope this brief historical summary explains my mixed origins
              in some way or another.
            </p>
            <p>

              <br>
              Moldova is the country where I was born, where I grew up, where
              I finished my master's degree. It's where most of my relatives,
              childhood friends, and former master's classmates are.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Moldova is the place of my childhood and student life, the place
              that I love and hate simultaneously, in a ratio of 50/50.
              Moldova is where I had many happy moments and unhappy moments. I
              can say that I know so much about what it's like to live in a
              country that hasn't woken up from the dream of the Soviet empire
              and that it potentially would take me a lifetime to write novels
              on this topic. That's why I will happily skip this dramatic part
              of the story and tell you the positive side of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              You won't believe that the most beautiful moments of my life in
              Moldova were simple things that would seem trivial to some of
              you. However, they were and are foundation stones for me: 1.
              When I had the opportunity to study at the university with
              extraordinary lecturers, PhDs in the field, and amazing
              colleagues; 2. When I had the chance to participate in the
              TEMPUS student exchange program at the Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik
              Stuttgart (2012); 3. When I completed a master's degree in
              Geoinformatics (2013), 4. When I regained Romanian citizenship
              (2014).
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              These were the most remarkable moments of my life in Moldova. I
              will always be grateful to the extraordinary people from
              ChiÈinÄu with whom I interacted throughout this period. Many
              other beautiful moments in my life also followed after I left
              Moldova, but I will tell you about them on another occasion.
            </p>
            <p>

              Thus, after 2014, I decided to leave my parental home and find a
              purpose in the world, so I moved to Romania for two years and
              then to Germany, where I have lived since then until now. I do
              not intend to return to Moldova because my professional and
              personal goals are no longer directly related to my country of
              origin â more details about this topic in subsequent posts.

              <br>
              Romania is the country that I consider the mother country of my homeland - Moldova. Romania is the country
              where my
              grandparents were born. Romania is the country of origin from which Moldova was forcibly separated and
              annexed by a war
              ultimatum to the USSR. Thus, from my subjective point of view, Moldova should be part of Romania or at
              least diplomatically united with Romania within UE.
              Significantly, the
              Romanian language is the state language of both countries, and both countries have many common Romanian
              traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              Although Romania is not an EU model country for other European countries, it could be a role model for
              Moldova's EU
              integration. If Moldova would reach at least the level of Romania's EU integration, it would be
              extraordinary, but
              there is still a long way to go. Unfortunately, Moldova kept getting lost on its UE path, taking one
              step forward
              and one step back. Thus, for three decades of independence from the USSR, Moldova remained in the same
              place, pacing and
              moving in circles around its stagnation. Until now, there are still citizens in Moldova who have not yet
              decided whether
              they want to join the EU or USSR. They still seem to like the USSR of the past and would like it to
              return, even
              though the USSR doesn't exist anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              From my purely subjective point of view, Romania and Moldova would do well to take inspiration from
              Germany and look for
              a diplomatic solution for reunification. However, it is a known fact that politicians from both countries
              do not even
              want to hear about an official reunification. Regardless of their opinion, as a citizen of both countries,
              I believe
              this is the
              best solution for both countries' economic and social development. Plus, from a historical point of view,
              they have
              always represented only one country, a country unified by the Romanian language and tradition.
            </p>

              <br>
              You may ask now why I don't consider Romania my country of destination; it's simple - neither Romania nor
              Moldova has
              yet concluded that the only solution for prosperity and development is a reunification of
              Moldova with Romania. Although, I also consider that the most diplomatic solution for the Union of Moldova
              with
              Romania is the EU, even
              if it does not represent the official
              union, it will still be the best symbolic union of two Romanian states within the EU. By the way, Germany
              also did a reunification 30 years ago, which only
              strengthened it.
              Imagine, by aberration, how the EU would have been now if Germany had not reunified in 1990. Would those
              two German
              countries have been separated as strongly as the current reunified Germany is? I'm sure not; social
              division only leads
              to decline and degradation.
            </p>

              <br>
              I wish with all my heart to seize during the years of life that God has reserved for me on this earth to
              see the
              reunification of Romania with Moldova within EU. Suppose current generations will not get a chance to
              witness a
              reunification. In
              that case, I hope that future generations will be able to accomplish what our current generations may not
              be able to
              accomplish.
