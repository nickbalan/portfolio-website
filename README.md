## My Role

## The 5 W's
- Who? — My professional network and potential employers. The website is for anyone interested in my professional work and who might want to contact me about it.
- What? — A responsive portfolio website built just with HTML and CSS.
- When? — The website might be visited when a potential employer checks out my previous experience or after I've met a professional contact. They would want to see what I'm up to nowadays.
- Where? — Potential employers might look at the website from their offices while networking contacts might access it from their mobile phones (e.g., after meeting me).
- Why? — For my potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about my professional experience and relevant skills and how to reach me. The website will also demonstrate my HTML and CSS front-end development skills to employers.
